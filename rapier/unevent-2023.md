## General Comments
* Rules are to be enforced as written.  None of them are optional.
* Outdated interpretations:
    * Auth questions are safety questions only
    * No dying defensively
    * Stop using "light"
* Chain shirts must be visually inspected.  That means they must be visible in their entirety to the inspecting marshal.
* Legal spear heads
* Advertise, advertise, advertise
* Society Marshal's Handbook is no more... Stay tuned
