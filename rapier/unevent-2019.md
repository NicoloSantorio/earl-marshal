* Multiple blades broken at tang
* Multiple darkwood tip blow-throughs
* Multiple tips removed due to tape failure
* Tip tape covering whole tip
* Tip tape color matching tip
* One "bird-blunt" tip failed (old tip, noticed between bouts)
* Chip strap failed
* Garments failed due to sewing issues (splitting at seems)
* Shirts without gussets
* Armor never been punch-tested

# Discussion Topics
## MOL interaction
* Marshals must present their authorization card to the MOLs upon signing in to marshal a given activity.

## Concussion Training
* All particpants, both fighters and marshals, *should* take concussion training.
* Signs and symptoms could be delayed, and might not even appear until mentally challenged.
* Current research shows helmets do NOT prevent concussions.
* Please take this [free class](http://www.med.umich.edu/neurosport/coach/story_html5.html) from the University of Michigan's Neuroscience department

## Marshal's Court
* At the end of every activity (tourney, melee, etc), RMIC *must* gather all supporting marshals together and discuss the activity.
* Identify and work through any identified issues.
* Interact with fighters involved in said issues.
* Write everything down, include it in the event report.
* The RMIC *must* attempt ot resolve *all* issues that day, and report what actions were taken for any issues.

## Your safety is your concern
* We advocate "don't hit your opponent hard."
* We advocate "take care of your opponents, they are your friends"
* Plenty of positive examples:
    * A fighter trips, not attacking them as they get back up
    * Warning your opponent that they are about to back into a fence/tree
* Handful of bad examples:
    * Abusing your opponent's good will by charging them without concern for your own safety.
    * "I might get hit excessively, but that's a risk I'm willing to take."

## Upcoming Kingdom Policy Changes
1. Aligning category names
    * Current: Light rapier, heavy rapier, and C&T rapier
    * Proposed: Light rapier, Rapier, and Cut & Thrust 
2. Requiring seperate auths for two-handed weapons
    * Proposed:
        * Seperate authorization for two-handed weapons in rapier and Cut & Thrust
    * Why:
        * Historically, there have been extensive problems with two-handed weapons
        * Demonstrably different skill
        * Aligning with many other communities (and the armored community in Atlantia)
3. Push cuts by default
    * Current: opt-in
    * Proposed: out-out
    * Why
        * Minimal observable difference
        * Limited risk in practice
        * Used within and outside of the SCA by novices and experts alike with no perceived additional issues
4. Minimum length of draw cuts
    * Current: 8" of minimal travel
    * Proposed: remove minimal travel
    * Why
        * Society removing limit
        * Multiple places that 12" draw would not be effective (draw cut to the ribs)
        * Multiple places that 2" draw could be fatal (femoral arteries)
        * In practice, Atlantians make their own judgement call for efficacy

## Latest Society Rules Draft
* Out for public comment since late October
* Expect this to go forwards with minimal changes

### Changes from Society that will impact us
* Grips can now be more than 1/3rd the length of the weapon. 
    * Multiple previously banned weapons are now allowed (See: Katanas)
* An opponent's front is now defined by two things:
    * position of their shoulders
    * AND reasonably be seen by their opponent
* Only "drop-tester" is valid for testing puncture resistant materials
    * Removes "Broken-foil" test
    * Darkwood sells a pre-made "kit"
    * Groups are encouraged to keep a "group-owned" tester
* "Projectile equipment" now has detailed rules
    * Equipment construction, draw strength, line of fire, etc
    * Proposing that projectile equipment should role up under "combat archery with rapier" warrants and authorizations
* Cloaks can now be thrown, targetting opponent's arm or weapon (but not head)
    * I tried and observed this action within the WMA community with participants from the beginner to expert capabilities.
    * No inherently large change to the game or safety
* Parry-only daggers are no longer banned
    * All blades must still be legal, but things like wooden daggers used only for parrying are no longer banned.
* Fighters hit in the legs are now allowed to move about on their knees.  
    * Historically, we have allowed “knee walk into engagement”, but this isn’t codified in policy.
    * No safety issue with knee walking.
    * Leaving the policy as is, and let the community decide how to proceed.
    * Marshals can add limits if they see fit
* C&T Leg shots are no longer disabling
    * Allows knee fighting in C&T
    * Receiver can still determine a leg-shot is "disabling"
* C&T melee is now allowed
    * Our participation had positive and extremely negative experiences
    * Intend to allow, but monitor carefully
    * Request a minimum ratio of at least 1 marshal to every 5 participants and detailed reporting

### Changes once Society rules are approved
1. Allowing rubber-headed spears
    * Current: Spears are banned
    * Proposed: Rubber-headed spears are allowed with auth (steel-tipped spears still banned)
    * Why
        * 9' total length, rattan shaft, characteristics of the tip defined in society rules
        * Multiple people indicated interest
        * Multiple reported positive experiences at multiple inter-kingdom events (Gulfwars, Pennsic, etc)
        * Addresses multiple concerns from "steel-headed" spears.

## Changes up for discussion
1. Tip cuts
    * Current: opt-in
    * Proposed: opt-out
    * Discussion:
        * "Good" tip cuts are lethal in practice
        * "Bad" tip cuts are wouldn't slice the skin of an apple
        * Significantly complex issue whenever members of our community travel to neighboring kingdoms, as we are not trained to deal with these blows.
        * PURELY cultural issue, NOT safety
    * Proposed:
        * Coordinated dissemination and demonstration of "good" and "bad" tip cuts
        * Work with marshals at large events to demonstrate and "required to accept" for the activity
        * Intent to move to an "opt-out" rather than "opt-in"
