* Practice reports not required unless there's an incident
* No quarterly reporting requirement to this office; that's a waiver reporting requirement

## Experiments

* Trying to get Grappling up and running before I retire

## General Comments
* 4.4 All gentles who wish to participate in combat activities in ANY CAPACITY at an event as defined in 4.3.1 must sign in with the MoL-IC of the event. (emphasis mine)
* Spear gauges - Please acquire something and add it to your tool kit
* Chain shirts - MUST be visually inspected per Society rules ([9.10](https://www.sca.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fencing-Marshals-Handbook_Jan2024.pdf)).  Repairs MUST be done with appropriate metal, such as jewelry jump rings, wire that's been welded or riveted, etc.
* Tips - Darkwood tips out of stock indefinitely; some recent blunt acquisitions are showing more rubber at the flat surface, leaving more room to bend and punch through the sides
* Rules rewrite still actively being worked at the Society level - SLOW progress
* Calibration - reports indicate a generally upward trend; stop that!
