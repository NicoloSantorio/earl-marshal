**Author**: Magister Percival Aldridge, KRM

## Staff
* New Kingdom Earl Marshal: Master Gordon Kinloch
* New Deputy for Rapier: Magister Percival Aldridge
* Deputies:
    * Master Cailin Blackwood
    * Master Dante di Pietro
    * Mistress Etain of Sutherland
    * Still looking for a new youth rapier deputy

## Stats
* 80 active rapier marshals (3% increase)
* 9 MITs (40% decrease)
* 3 Youth rapier marshals (40% decrease)
* Authorized fighters:
    * Heavy Rapier: 433
    * Heavy Rapier 2H: 26
    * Light Rapier: 152
    * C&T: 124
    * C&T 2H: 38
    * Rapier Spear: 30
* Reminder that we have no "longsword" authorization in rapier

## Sanctions
Allen of Wolfhou
* All warrants are suspended through April 1, 2023
* All martial authorizations except Target Archery suspended until April 1, 2023

## Rules Updates
* Authorizations at practice no longer require pre-approval, but WILL require a report
* Spatulated tips are clear for use without additional metal discs - please report if you have problems
* Clarified that C&T calibration is NOT higher than heavy rapier
* Rapier spear minimum length is now 4 feet
* Reminder that spear auths are good for both heavy rapier AND C&T
* Grievances are no longer REQUIRED to be aired on the field - use your judgement about following up privately

## Reporting
* 48 reports for 2022: 25 events, 3 practices
* Equipment failures:
    * 2 tang breaks
    * 1 quillion break
    * 7 tip failures including our first spear
    * 2 blades bent past safe
    * 1 helmet rivet failed
* ALL marshals should review the reporting requirements in 3.1.3.8.  Starting in the 2023 calendar year, I will direct my deputies to reach out to the submitter for anything missing prior to approving reports.
* Give us more information than required, please.  A report that says "7 auths, 1 failed" is ok, but a report that says "7 auths: Jane Doe, HR - Passed; John Doe, C&T - failed due to calibration;" is MUCH better
* Following event rapier reports are currently missing according to the warrant database:
    * Fall University: 9/17/22
    * Buckston Birthday Bash: 11/12/22 (although I'm pretty sure there was none)
    * Harvest Gathering: 11/19/22
* Official practices require waiver reporting
* I WILL start enforcing the suspension period for missed deadlines outlined in 3.1.3.8.5 starting in calendar year 2023

## Experiments
* None active at this time
* Dussack experiment is still waiting on approval or rejection from Society
* Likely to join two others at Society level, pending sufficient answers to my inquiries:
    * Reduced Armor
    * Non-metal weapons alternatives
